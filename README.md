# Antarctic Sea Ice Phase Analysis

This project analyzes the timing of Antarctic sea ice advance and retreat using satellite-derived sea ice area (SIA) data. It compares traditional and invariant annual cycles, investigates spatial and temporal phase variability, and explores climatological drivers of sea ice behavior.

## Structure
- `data/` — Raw NetCDF or CSV files (not tracked in Git)
- `scripts/python/` — Core Python workflows (e.g., phase detection, clustering)
- `scripts/R/` — R-based statistical models or diagnostics
- `notebooks/` — Exploratory Jupyter notebooks
- `figures/` — Final figure outputs for dissertation
- `results/` — Intermediate outputs like pixel-level DOY or anomaly maps
- `env/` — Environment setup files (conda or pip)

## Setup
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:fridalejandra/sea-ice-phase.git
